To customize the view, click on “Filter” in the upper right:

-   **Tags** are applied to success criteria. When selecting a tag, only the criteria that have that tag associated with them are visible, the others are hidden. If you select multiple tags, every success criteria is displayed that has one or more of the tags.

-   With the **Levels** filter, it is possible to hide levels of conformance that are currently not relevant to the user, for example hide Level AAA if testing for Levels A and AA.

-   The **Technologies** filter tailors down the list of techniques for each success criterion to show only techniques for the technologies used.

-   By using the **Techniques** filter, you can by default hide sufficient and/or advisory techniques as well as failures by default. Such technique types can also be shown or hidden on a success criteria basis.

*Note:* Other success criteria than the ones shown after filtering might also apply in certain circumstances.

**Share** a link to this view by chosing the button in the top bar, or send links to specific success criteria by using the share button.
