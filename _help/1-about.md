This document is a customizable list of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (aka WCAG 2.0). This allows for tailoring the guidelines and other material to the needs of the person using them.

It provides:

-   All of the requirements (called “success criteria”) from WCAG 2.0
-   Techniques to meet the requirements, which are linked to pages with descriptions, code examples, browser and assistive technology support notes, and tests.
-   Failures to avoid, which are linked to pages with descriptions, examples, and tests.
-   “Understanding” links to pages that explain the intent of the guideline or success criterion, how it helps people with different disabilities, key terms, and resources.

You can customize what is included in this page by selecting from the “Filter” sidebar which Technologies, [Levels](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20130905/conformance.html#uc-levels-head) of success criteria, and Sections of techniques you want to include. Also, you can use tags to filter by use cases.
