All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below.

***

-   **Controls, Input:** If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose. (Refer to *Guideline 4.1* for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)

-   **Time-Based Media:** If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to *Guideline 1.2* for additional requirements for media.)

-   **Test:** If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in text, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.

-   **Sensory:** If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.

-   **CAPTCHA:** If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.

-   **Decoration, Formatting, Invisible:** If non-text content is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.
