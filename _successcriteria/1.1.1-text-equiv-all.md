All [non-text content](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#non-text-contentdef){:.termref} that is presented to the user has a [text alternative](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#text-altdef){:.termref} that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below.

-   **Controls, Input:** If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a [name][] that describes its purpose. (Refer to *[Guideline 4.1][]* for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)

-   **Time-Based Media:** If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to *[Guideline 1.2][]* for additional requirements for media.)

-   **Test:** If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in [text][], then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.

-   **Sensory:** If non-text content is primarily intended to create a [specific sensory experience][], then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.

-   **[CAPTCHA][]:** If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.

-   **Decoration, Formatting, Invisible:** If non-text content is [pure decoration][], is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by [assistive technology][].
