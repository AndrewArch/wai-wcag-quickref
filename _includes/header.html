          <ul>
            <li>Not all Success Criteria have been imported.</li>
            <li>Currently only WCAG techniques are present in this mockup, I will add links to other supporting documents in the next few days.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Customization is just shaping up.
          <ul>
            <li>Currently only the selection of the Levels is working.</li>

      <p><strong>Please look at</strong> the general impression. Compare with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/">current “How to Meet” document</a>, assume that all categories and content are in there. Focus on the <a href="#filters">customization panel</a> on the top of the page and the general framework.</p>
